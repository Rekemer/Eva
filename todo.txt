add error if use undeclared variable
refactor DETERMINE_X_RET


a= a++ doesn work
make a = a++ to have zero effect on stack


make user cast?
if 2.0+2.0 == 4


refactor equal in AST and compile.cpp

local variables are on stack
if we want to change them or read them,
we use indicies that we calcualte prior to usage of variables

rework access to string, make it more accessible
rework token leaking to backend
